Side scroller 2D proof of concept game

This project serves as a proof of concept to creating a 2D game utilizing the Unity Game Engine. Additionally, I am hoping to integrate the usage of Amazon Web Services to leverage services such as server hosting as well as making use of DyanmoDB to store player information between games. This will help to create a fully fledged (albeit very simple) game that can be operated in a multiplayer capacity as well as utilizing cloud data storage. Below is a video of this specific game in its very early and barebone stages

**Currently work in progress**
